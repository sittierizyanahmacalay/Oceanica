	<p class="ssfactone"> Sea bunny anatomy can be a little deceptive. First off, the white fur coat you see on these sea slugs can actually range in color from yellow to orange to even brown. Secondly, it’s definitely not fur. What you’re looking at are groups of small rods known as caryophyllidia covering the nudibranch’s back. These are arranged around small black specks that give the sea bunny its spotted look. Most experts believe that these organs play a sensory role.</p>
	<p class="ssfacttwo"> The rhythmic flapping of its wings propels the sea angel through the open ocean, and gives it the appearance of flying. While the graceful movements of this swimming snail may make it look like an angel, it's really a prowling predator. Using a structure called buccal cones, the sea angel removes its prey directly from its shell.</p>
	<p class="ssfactthree"> Leaf sheep have rhinophores on their heads that look like the ears of a sheep in perspective to their faces. They also resemble antennae on insects. The leaf sheep’s rhinophores have fine hairs that sense chemicals in the water, enabling them to find food sources. </p>
	<p class="ssfactfour"> Dirona albolineata is a pink or white translucent sea slug with out a shell. It has dominate plate-like cerata projecting off its body. These cerata are white along the edges and at the tips. This is what seperates it the most from other nudibranchs. These cerata are flat and pointed and cover the whole body. The gills of this nudibranch can be found under the mantle and are used for respiration.</p>
	<p class="ssfactfive"> The clade Anaspidea, commonly known as sea hares (Aplysia species and related genera), are medium-sized to very large opisthobranch gastropod molluscs with a soft internal shell made of protein. These are marine gastropod molluscs in the superfamilies Aplysioidea and Akeroidea. </p>
	<p class="ssfactsix"> The Janolus fuscus can be identified by its many large cerata tipped with orange and white. The cerata, which have brown inner cores, project from all over the dorsal surface of the animal including in front of the rhinophores. </p>
