	<p class="jfactone"> The lion’s mane jellyfish, or the arctic red jellyfish, is the largest type of jellyfish. They measure up to 8 feet in diameter and 120 feet in length. The lion’s mane jellyfish has a bell with eight lobes and about 150 tentacles trailing behind it. The color of their bells ranges from light orange to tan to deep orange and crimson red. </p>
	<p class="jfacttwo"> The crystal jellyfish is a bioluminescent jellyfish that is almost entirely transparent when it is not glowing. When disturbed, crystal jellies emit a green light from the rim of their bells. This is what makes them so important to science. The crystal jellyfish is the source of the Green Fluorescent Protein that scientists use as cell markers. </p>
	<p class="jfactthree"> The black sea nettle jellyfish provides food and protection to the Pacific butterfish. The butterfish feeds on plankton that the jellyfish gathers, and when danger approaches, they hide in its stomach.  </p>
	<p class="jfactfour"> The jellyfish's brown oral arms are almost joined at the base but branch into forked branches. They also have many long, thin tentacles. They feed on fish eggs, shrimp, algae, and plankton. Although the cauliflower has venom deadly to its prey, it is harmless to humans. It is so harmless that people in some parts of Asia eat this crown jellyfish. </p>
	<p class="jfactfive"> The pink meanie jellyfish is bright blush pink jelly. This beautiful but deadly jellyfish likes to feed on other jellies. The moon jellyfish happens to be its favorite snack. Perhaps their predatory inclination is what earned them the ‘meanie’ in their name. </p>
	<p class="jfactsix"> The mushroom cap jellyfish has a dense and thick bell, shaped like a mushroom cap, with a  diameter of up to 20 inches. It doesn't have tentacles but has eight thick oral arms with finger-shaped appendages. The color of the bell ranges from creamy white to pale yellow, pink, or green. The oral arms usually have brown markings on the free ends. </p>
