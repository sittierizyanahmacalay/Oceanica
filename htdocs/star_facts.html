	<p class="stfactone"> Leather stars get their name because they are smooth and slippery to the touch, like wet leather. They are bluish gray with red and orange mottling. Their five arms are boarder and shorter than many other stars, and they can range in size up to 12‚Äù. </p>
	<p class="stfacttwo"> Granulated Sea Stars are carnivores that, like other sea stars, has its mouth on the underside of its body. Food is digested and absorbed outside of its body by forcing its stomach out of its mouth onto the food. Its food includes small invertebrates such as coral polyps as well as carrion </p>
	<p class="stfactthree"> Small clams are they favourite food, and they will swallow them whole. As they can't digest their shell, they will regurgitate the shell. </p>
	<p class="stfactfour"> Crown-of-Thorns are known to be more successful at preying on large swaths of coral reefs when the corals are already stressed. During times of coral bleaching or stresses caused by human activities, outbreaks of the crown-of-thorn starfish may be particularly destructive. </p>
	<p class="stfactfive"> Despite being proper starfish, Brisingid Sea Stars look and live more like a Crinoid or Basket Star. They have as many as 20 arms, each one bristling with spines. These spines are covered in thousands of tiny snapping jaws for capturing prey that drifts by. </p>
	<p class="stfactsix"> Necklace Starfish possess a cleverly evolved arsenal of hydraulic tube feet connected to an elaborate water-vascular system that encircles the animal's mouth and extends via five radial canals down the centre of each arm.</p>
