	<p class="sfactone"> Whale sharks are filter feeders and can neither bite nor chew. They can process more than 6,000 litres of water an hour through their gills. Although its mouth can stretch to four feet wide, a whale shark’s teeth are so tiny that they can only eat small shrimp, fish and plankton by using their gill rakers as a suction filter. </p>
	<p class="sfacttwo"> Whilst many think of these beasts as fearsome man-eaters, humans aren’t, in fact, on the great white’s menu. There are around 5-10 attacks a year, but researchers believe that, rather than preying on humans to eat them, the sharks are instead taking a “sample bite” out of curiosity, before swimming off. </p>
	<p class="sfactthree"> Unlike most sharks, which require constant motion to move water over their gills and maintain a sufficient internal blood pressure, the nurse shark often remains motionless along the bottom - actively pumping water over its gills through the continual opening and closing of its mouth. </p>
	<p class="sfactfour"> The cephalofoil is responsible for the distinctive shape of the hammerhead group and serves many purposes including giving them superior depth perception and binocular vision, aiding hammerheads in navigation and finding food. Scientists also believe that the size of the cephalofoil gives hammerheads a greater number of electroreceptors than in other sharks - increasing their navigational and prey detection abilities. </p>
	<p class="sfactfive"> Stoutly bull sharks get their name from their short, blunt snout, stocky appearance and bullish nature. These compact powerhouses reach an average length of three-and-a-half metres and can weigh up to a whopping 500 pounds. As one of the most dangerous shark species of the sea, these aggressive predators will often head-butt their prey before attacking. </p>
	<p class="sfactsix"> Contrary to the lemon shark's menacing grimace with their protruding curved teeth, these animals are actually quite gentle and non-aggressive towards humans. As such, they are very popular amongst scuba divers for baited shark diving throughout the world. </p>
